        Combination of a heatmap and a bubble chart to represent datasets placed in categories. The bubbles represent 
        the ammount of data belonging to each category combination, while the heatmap below represents the desirability
        of the data. The main purpose of this combination would be to display data together with how desireable the 
        different datapoints are. One usecase could be to display weather data together with the desirability of the 
        different weather combinations as shown in the example above.
